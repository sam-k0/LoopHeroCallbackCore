# LoopHeroCallbackCore
Module needed by my mods in order to function correctly.
Reason is that multiple mods cannot hook and then call the same game event, so this will handle it.

## How to use
- To manage the mods, go to "Camp"
- Press "ESC" or the settings button to bring up the settings
- Click on the "Mods" button in the bottom right corner

The currently loaded and blacklisted mods are shown in a list.

You can then press F11 to change the configuration.
To apply changes, you need to restart the game as the modloader will only check the config at the start of the game.
